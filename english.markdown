Welcome to TAKABE group websiteÔºÅ
</font><br>


<font size="4">
This research group deals with various topics related to large-scale random systems.<br>
For example, the topics include
<ul>
<li> trainable algorithms based on deep unfolding/deep learning for signal processing, wireless communication, and optimization</li>
<li> theoretical analysis of random systems called spinglass, such as combinatorial optimization, random graphs, and inference</li>
<li> error correcting codes, especially LDPC codes</li>
<li> efficient sampling methods, such as MCMC and particle-based variational inference</li>
<li> quantum(-simulated) algorithms for optimization</li>
</ul>
